**Provided extra prompts needed to make the site better or fix issues**
*fix prompts samples :*

 make the sections to the middle and i don't like how it looks like right now , make it more dynamic and add some more style to it such as card 

 Like this I've given prompt generate images for adding to the website

fixing - about us : add class for second p and add style making it stand out from first p


*I manually did most of the color combination matching , css styling to make the website come together as a whole, added extra html tags to align it together*


**Tested in 2 browsers and provided answer to it being responsive**
Google Chrome 134.0.3124.93 and Microsoft Edge 134.0.3124.93
website is responsive as checked!


**validated the html and css all good to go** 
There was initial errors which I cleared off later to load it better. 


**Listed 5 things that Copilot did well.**
1. created a skeleton for 4 pages.
2. created basic css styles to all the pages
3. initial brain storming for the website which I already had in mind
4. added images for most part of my website
5. cleared most of the fix request prompt!

**Added images to site manually correctly**

done most of the image addition usinng copilot and some from other sources

**Final question answered with all 3 points addressed**

1.My final thought on using copilot for creating website would have mixed response as I can relay on it to create a skeleton content and style as well as fix prompts but it don't completely create all the website as once, ofcourse we should brain storm first about what we actually need and what expectations we have about our required website. 
2.It didn't clear of lot of alignment problems which I tried to give the prompt where I had to manually fix all the stuff also I doesn't support complex designs to make it dynamic and standout if we need that we should give the prompt a lot of times instead we can do that itself instead of giving one by one prompt. also if we are not giving clear prompt I can take wrong direction and create problems in already fixed files.
I would say designer did a basic job but I couldn't completely accomadate all the image creation requirements as I was out of credits to create more. Also I doesn't have best prompt detection algo as it created a basic image according to prompt i gave, I did gave multiple detailed prompts but it didn't generate well I would say which is appealing to view in a website as per saying! so basically it did a average performance for image generation.

3.My final word on this would be using copilot for web development would be great and helpful to an great extend but the job of doing a website as a whole will always be in the hand of a person who is developing the website 
also It would help on saving so much time when we need to get things done for creating a website but It has it's own drawbacks as it would end up messing the website if we are not using it for correct purpose and the prompt we give has to be accurate.
